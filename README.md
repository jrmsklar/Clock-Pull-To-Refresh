Clock-Pull-To-Refresh
=====================

Cool clock pull-to-refresh animation

This utilizes a third party pull to refresh API (EGORefreshTableHeaderView), in addition with a newly created class (JSPullToRefreshClock),
to present a cool and fun pull to refresh animation.

The clock hands animate up toward the noon position when pulling down, and down towards the 6 o'clock position when pulling up.
When released, the clock hands both rotate counter clockwise at different rates, indicating that the data is loading.

See the demo for directions of use.
